             Until one day, a drought came and food became scarce.
                   The crops of the humans were destroyed.
              But the clever monkeys kept all their bananas safe.

                                    `-----'
   The huamns waged a war against all the monkeys for the remaining bananas.
                 At last all but one ANGRY monkey survived.
