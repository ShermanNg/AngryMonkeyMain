In a Long Long Time Ago,
Humans and Monkeys lived together in peace,
until a drought came and food became scarce.
The crops of the humans were destroyed.
But the clever monkeys kept all their bananas safe.
The huamns waged a war against all the monkeys for the remaining bananas.
At last all but one ANGRY monkey survived. He must defend his remaining bananas at all cost.
